Hello , The files are for a FiveM server which i used to work onto.

Around 80% of the scripts have some edits from the base variants. es_extended has most changes made due to bugs made by the developers, which needed patching / fixing + added logs on picking / dropping items due to duplication issue with ESX platform. Duplicating weapons fixed (dropping and picking up) , work around for players that login with multiple clients implemented aswell to get rid of them if they try silly things.

Most robberies are logged aswell you just need to put your discord webhooks in order to make it work. I usually put it at the top of server side files , make sure to check there. Chat has been logged aswell via JDLogs (you gotta put your webhooks there aswell)

Did edit the script for weapon magazines in order to make it stack the bullets and not only load the currently used clip. (but also to store and stack bullets)

I did remove the custom clothes and cars before uploding it. Some scripts are optimized, some are not. (didn't have a lot of time doing that)

I am not supporting it, yet if you have any questions i might answer on my discord BlooD#9054
